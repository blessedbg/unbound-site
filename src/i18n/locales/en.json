      "trauma": {
        "question": "Will this reopen trauma or make me feel worse?",
        "answer": "The Unbound method is designed to be trauma-informed and gentle. We focus on building awareness and new patterns rather than diving deep into past trauma. You'll work at your own pace and can pause whenever you need to. If you have severe trauma, I recommend working with a therapist alongside this program."
      },
      "relationship": {
        "question": "Does this work if I'm already in a relationship?",
        "answer": "Unbound is designed to help you improve your current relationship by breaking patterns of anxiety, overthinking, and insecurity. The tools help you show up more securely and communicate more effectively."
      },
      "therapy": {
        "question": "Is this just talk therapy or positive thinking?",
        "answer": "Not at all. This is a practical, action-based system that combines neuroscience, attachment theory, and cognitive behavioral techniques. You'll get specific tools, exercises, and strategies that create real change in how your nervous system responds to relationships."
      },
      "results": {
        "question": "How soon will I see results?",
        "answer": "Most women notice shifts in awareness within the first week and begin changing their responses within 2-3 weeks. Deeper pattern changes typically happen over 2-3 months of consistent practice. Remember, you're rewiring decades of conditioning – be patient and compassionate with yourself."
      },
      "single": {
        "question": "Do I have to be dating to benefit from this?",
        "answer": "No! This program is just as valuable if you're single and taking a break from dating. You can work on your patterns, build secure attachment with yourself, and prepare for healthier relationships when you're ready. Many women find this the perfect time to do the deep work."
      },
      "tried": {
        "question": "What if I've tried everything and nothing has worked?",
        "answer": "I understand that frustration – I felt the same way. The difference with Unbound is that we address the nervous system patterns that drive your attraction, not just surface behaviors. If you've done therapy but still find yourself attracted to the same types of people, this program fills that gap."
